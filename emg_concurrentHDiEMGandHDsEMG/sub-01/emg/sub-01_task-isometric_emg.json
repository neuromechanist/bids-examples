(ii) Invasive EMG: A guiding filament inserted into a 25-gauge needle was used to place the thin-film structure in the muscle. Afterwards, the needle is withdrawn, leaving only the thin-film array within the muscle. Two bands damped with water were placed around the ankle as ground (R2) and reference (R1) electrodes.",
